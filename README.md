# ESP32-ESP8266-AES-Encrypted-Comm
Secure communication between ESP8266 and ESP32 using AES encryption

# 🔐 ESP32 & ESP8266 AES Encrypted Communication over Wi-Fi

In a world where data is increasingly being transmitted wirelessly, securing that data is essential. This project implements AES encryption for secure communication between an ESP8266 (Sensor Node) and an ESP32 (Central Server/Receiver) over Wi-Fi. The sensor node sends sensitive data (like temperature, DO levels, passwords, etc.), which is encrypted using AES and decrypted securely on the receiving end.

This forms the core of a secure IoT architecture, suitable for applications in:

Industrial automation
Smart agriculture
Aquaculture monitoring
Smart homes
Secure sensor networks

🔧 KEY COMPONENTS
Component	Role
ESP8266	Sender Node – Collects or generates data and sends it to ESP32
ESP32	Receiver Node – Decrypts and processes the data
Wi-Fi	Communication layer between ESPs
AES Library	Encrypts and decrypts messages securely (128-bit AES)
Arduino / PlatformIO	Development platforms

📈 PROJECT FLOW
Data Generation: ESP8266 either reads from a sensor or generates mock data.
Encryption: ESP8266 encrypts this data using AES.
Transmission: Encrypted data is sent over Wi-Fi to ESP32.
Decryption: ESP32 decrypts the data using the same AES key.
Display / Action: Data is printed to Serial or used to control outputs.

✅ IMPORTANCE OF THIS PROJECT
🔐 Security Focused: Demonstrates practical use of cryptography (AES) in IoT.

🔄 ALTERNATIVE IDEAS (BASED ON THIS PROJECT)
OTA Firmware Updates with AES Validation
Use AES to verify firmware authenticity before updating ESP8266 via ESP32.

AES + MQTT Cloud IoT Gateway
ESP32 acts as a secure IoT gateway, forwarding decrypted sensor data to a cloud server using MQTT.

Mesh Network + Encryption
Integrate this with a PainlessMesh for secure mesh communication among multiple nodes.

AES-Encrypted Local Storage
Store encrypted data in SPIFFS/SD card to prevent data theft in case of physical access.
